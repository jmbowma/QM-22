The main file containing 253646 B3LYP/cc-pVDZ energies for C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>30</sub> are split into 13 parts. Download them all and unzip to get the data file.

The folder "testing" contains the testing data for transferability from C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> to C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>62</sub>, calculated at B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level of theory.

The folder "LCCSD(T)" contains the PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12/AVTZ' energies calculated at 4514 selected C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>30</sub> configurations. Here AVTZ' means aug-cc-pVTZ for C and cc-pVTZ for H.
